<h1 style="color:green;">Aditi Purandare!</h1>
<p style="color:purple;">Welcome to my page! I'm a sophomore Econ/UEP double major at Occidental College, but I'm originally from the Bay Area!</p>
<p style="color:purple;"> I love listening to music, reading, hanging out with my friends, and spending time with my cat </p>

This is not my cat but it's so cute!
